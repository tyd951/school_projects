What you need to do on project 1.1, 1.2, 1.3:

1) Run your histogram program on Proj1_data1.
2) Run your threshold program on Proj1_data1 4 separate times,
         using four different threshold values:
        4, 5, 6 and 7

     Afterward, you should have four different output files:
        Proj1_data1_thr_4
        Proj1_data1_thr_5
        Proj1_data1_thr_6
        Proj1_data1_thr_7

3) Run your prettyPring program on  each threshold outputs,
     Afterward, you should have four different output files:

        Proj1_data1_thr_4_PP
        Proj1_data1_thr_5_PP
        Proj1_data1_thr_6_PP
        Proj1_data1_thr_7_PP

4) Submit soft copies of project 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 in three(3) 
   seperate emails!!!!!!!! (You must follow the instruction stated in project
   submission specs.)
 
5) Submit hard copies of project 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 in three(3) 
   seperate stacks!!!!!!!! (You must follow the instructions 
   in HardCopySubmission specs given.)
